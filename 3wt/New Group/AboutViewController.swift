As I started spending more and more time flying in empty planes, I always thought it was such a waste, and whenever I told my friends what I was doing they would beg to come with me. I then started thinking about all the people who don't have pilot friends, but would love the chance to go up in a small plane either just to do some sight seeing, or to beat the traffic of a regional trip."
